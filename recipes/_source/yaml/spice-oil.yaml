description: |
  Use this spice oil on salads, in cold noodle dishes, or on roasted or sautéed vegetables. If you have trouble finding the spices, you can get all of them at most Asian grocery stores.

ingredients:
  required:
    - 1 clove garlic 
    - 1 cup olive or vegetable oil 
    - 2 tbsp chili flakes or dried red chilies 
    - 1 tsp Sichuan or regular peppercorns 
    - 1 star anise
    - ½ tsp cumin seeds
    - ¼ tsp salt

instructions: |
  Use the side of a knife to crush the garlic clove until it cracks open. Add all of the ingredients to a small pot.

  Warm the mixture over low heat for about 10 minutes, until it starts to bubble gently and you can hear a bit of a sizzle, then turn off the heat. You want to heat it just enough to let the spices infuse into the oil, without getting so hot that the spices start to cook or fry.

  Remove the pot from the stovetop and put it in the fridge with a lid. Let the spices infuse for 4 to 8 hours.

  Taste the oil. If it isn’t strongly spicy, let it infuse for a few more hours. Once it’s ready, strain through a sieve to remove the spices.

  Store in a jar in the fridge for up to a week.
