  This is one of my favorite ways to use roasted cauliflower other than eating it straight. It’s a delicious change from the usual vegetable taco offerings. Just look at all those crunchy bits!

ingredients:
  required:
    - "[roasted cauliflower](smoky-and-spicy-roasted-cauliflower.yaml)"
    - 6 tortillas
    - ½ cup cheese, grated
    - ½ cup salsa (p. 163) or sauce of choice

instructions: |
  Warm up the tortillas in the microwave for 20 to 30 seconds, or put them in a warm oven covered with a towel while you prepare everything else.
  
  Place two to three tortillas on each plate and fill with a generous serving of cauliflower.

  Sprinkle the grated cheese over top and drizzle with salsa or sauce of your choice. Enjoy!
